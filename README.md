# NUCC Workshop of Java 2023/2024

Welcome to the repository for the NUCC Workshop of Java 2023/2024. This
README contains a summary of the presentation given during the workshop,
as well as code examples for a Car class and implementations of queues,
stacks, and linked lists in Java.

You can find the presentation slides in PDF format here.

A basic example of a singly linked list was presented to demonstrate the
concept of linked data structures. (code in the `examples/` folder)

We hope this repository and presentation were helpful for your Java
programming journey. Feel free to explore the code examples and adapt
them to your projects.
